# Verification map

Run from the repository root. The [agent handoff](../docs/AGENT-HANDOFF.md)
records the last qualified implementation and CI URL. The
[workflow](../.github/workflows/validate.yml) specifies clean Debian dependencies,
DSH installation/environment and package acceptance steps.

| Area | Checks | Evidence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript / SDK contracts | `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `npm test` | Real Pi SDK with deterministic model fixtures; inspect skipped integrations |
| Native UI / service logic | `npm run test:native` | Python and real Qt widgets, usually offscreen; matching QtTest required |
| Browser DOM | `node --test apps/browser/test/*.test.mjs` | DOM/bridge fixtures, not installed Chrome acceptance |
| Automatic memory | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_hindsight_memory.py`; `node --test tests/dual-memory-integration.test.mjs` | Fake HTTP engine plus actual DSH/Pi lifecycle; follow workflow's locked DSH setup |
| Actual memory engine / model | `python3 scripts/proof-controlled-memory.py --help` | Disposable pinned engine, explicit fixture/live modes, archive isolation and bounded real-model completion |
| Maintenance | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_lifecycle.py` | Lifetime locks, preserved backups, real temporary memory service shutdown |
| DSH approval / questions / forks | `scripts/dsh-setup-proof.py` with workflow flags | Actual DSH and Qt, deterministic model |
| Native pointer / clipboard | `bash scripts/native-x11-proof.sh` | Isolated X11 desktop, actual input/clipboard |
| Prompt editor | `python3 scripts/prompt-editor-proof.py` | Qt and actual shared service |
| First run | `AUGMENTOR_UI_PROOF=scripts/first-run-proof.py bash scripts/native-x11-proof.sh` | Actual Qt model form and Pi with fixture provider |
| Installed Debian | `scripts/debian-package-proof.sh`, `scripts/lifecycle-proof.sh` | Container engine and built/checksummed packages required; upgrade/refusal/rollback/removal |
| Packaged browser | Workflow `browser-package` job | Real packaged companion and extension as ordinary user |
| Voice | [Separate voice checks](https://github.com/ManoloRemiddi/resonant-voice/blob/main/docs/AGENT-HANDOFF.md) | Engine/plugin tests distinct from physical microphone and listening acceptance |

Never run container-only package removal scripts directly on the host. Do not
reuse real user state for tests. Logs in ignored `outputs/` are local artifacts;
publish a concise result, exact ref, command and limitations in GitHub rather
than requiring future agents to find those files. Dated verification ledgers
remain valid only for their recorded builds and environments.


Native voice coverage includes `test_voice.py`, `test_voice_hands_free.py`,
`test_voice_input.py` and `test_voice_echo_guard.py`. Use the full discovery
command above so Qt gesture tests are included. The September 19 echo/buffer
change corrected three older gesture methods accidentally placed after the
unittest main guard; earlier suite totals did not include those methods.
Waveform fixtures check echo rejection and an independent signal, not human
listening quality. The [hands-free guide](../docs/HANDS-FREE-IMPLEMENTATION.md)
separates these from the physical capture/speaker probe and deployment scope.


## Restart reliability

`test_recovery.py` and `test_desktop_startup.py` cover saved-chat refusal, explicit
managed-runtime startup, multi-frame legacy-history repair and canonical launchers.
`scripts/proof-recovery.py` uses disposable real runtimes.
`scripts/startup-recovery-proof.py --live` deliberately stops idle installed
services and SIGKILLs the idle desktop to verify supervision; it refuses active
DSH/voice work. See [qualification and limits](../docs/RESTART-RELIABILITY-2026-09-20.md).

Controlled admission/context: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_memory_budget.py` and `node --test tests/memory-context.test.mjs`. See [qualification](../docs/CONTROLLED-MEMORY.md).

- Bounded execution and terminal response validity (24 focused cases, including real DSH lifecycle and one isolated hook fixture): `node --test tests/dsh-execution.test.mjs` uses real pinned DSH with fixture HTTP; see [contract](../docs/BOUNDED-EXECUTION-RECOVERY.md).

Action-outcome contracts: `node --test tests/dsh-action-outcomes.test.mjs tests/dsh-execution.test.mjs`. Real DSH fixture coverage includes duplicate mutations, lost acknowledgments, background collection and concluding handoffs after truncation. The complete-container proof verifies the execution adapter is installed once in each preset and its dependent module is shipped.
